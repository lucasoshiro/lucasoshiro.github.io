<p>Hello, welcome, stalker. Make yourself at home, look everywhere... </p>

<p>In this website, I post some personal projects and some university projects
that I found interesting. I also list my contributions to free/libre/open source
software.</p>

<p> If you are a recruiter, please read my <a href="cv-en">complete resumé</a>.

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  I'm a brazilian computer scientist, currently studying for a master's degree
  at University of São Paulo.
</p>

<p>
  As you can see in this personal page, I really enjoy doing side-projects that
  not exactly aim to be useful, but different, challenging and, above all,
  fun.
</p>

<p>
  Some things that I like (and you can see it by reading my posts here):

  <ul>
    <li>Programming, in general</li>
    <li>3D printing</li>
    <li>Electronics, even though I have never formaly studied it</li>
    <li>Vintage stuff, e.g.: old clocks, record players, typewriters etc</li>
    <li>Fixing things, like the ones on the previous item, sometimes using the 3 first items</li>
    <li>Music, mainly Prog Rock, Classical and 80s</li>
    <li>Movies, no matter the year they were made</li>
    <li>Maps (ok, I know it is weird)</li>
    <li>Learning how stuff works, sometimes opening their hood</li>
  </ul>

</p>
