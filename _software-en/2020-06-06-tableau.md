Class work for the subject MAC0239 (Introduction to Logic Reasoning and Program
Verification) of IME-USP, written in October 2016 with
[Matheus Tavares](https://matheustavares.gitlab.io/).

This Java code reads a logic expression and returns and shows the possible
values that make that statement true.

### 2023 Update

This code dates from the beginning of my programmer life. At the time, that was
the most elegant code that I had written. The code itself looks elegant to me
even to this date, however, I reckon that it doesn't follow Java good practices
(e. g. it could use Gradle instead of Makefile, and Javadoc instead of comments).
