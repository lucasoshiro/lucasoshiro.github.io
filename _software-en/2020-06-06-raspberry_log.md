Raspberry Pi usage dada utility. It can measure the following metrics:

- CPU Temperature;
- CPU Usage;
- Power (if it is connect to an INA219 sensor, measuring its own current);
- RAM Usage;
- Download rate;
- Upload rate;
- Disk I/O:
  - read and write count;
  - read and write byte count;
  - time spent on reading and writing on disk;
