## Academic overview

- Bachelor in Computer Science at [University of São Paulo](https://usp.br);
- Currently studying for a master's degree in Computer Science at
  [University of São Paulo](https://usp.br);

Formerly, I started other courses that I didn't finished:

- Systems Analysis and Development at [Fatec São Paulo](https://www.fatecsp.br/)
- Saxophone at [Escola Municipal de Música de São Paulo](https://capital.sp.gov.br/web/fundacao_theatro_municipal/escola_de_musica)

## Technical Skills

Here I classify my technical skills freely following the
[Dreyfus model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition):

- **Novice**: I already worked with that skill, but I still don't have
  independence and need help from other people, from documentation, from online
  resources and so on;

- **Advanced beginner**: I have some independence and can perform simpler tasks
  without help, but I still need help (asking other people or trying to study by
  myself) to do more complex tasks;

- **Competent**: I am mostly independent, I can troubleshoot, I can solve
  problems, I can make technical decisions and I can plan tasks that depend on
  that skill. However, I still need guidance on special situations and I'm still
  mostly guided some patterns and recipes;

- **Proficient**: I'm independent on performing tasks that involves that skill
  and I don't need to follow patterns or guidance. If there's no expert in my
  team, probably I will be one of the people that my colleagues will ask for
  help;

- **Expert**: I deeply understand that skill, I'm was a reference in that skill
  in places that I worked and, sometimes, outside them.

Here I'm not only listing thoses skills, but explaning when and how I used them,
sometimes with examples.

### Programming languages

Please note that in this section I'm covering the languages themselves, but not
their ecosystems and tooling, which are covered in the [stacks section](#stacks)

- **Python** (Proficient): my swiss-knife language;

- **C** (Proficient): the language that I used the most during my
  undergratuation;

- **OpenSCAD** (Proficient): OpenSCAD is my main tool for modeling objects for
  3D printing, for example, [this Braille generator](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6463849).
  I gave [a course divided in 6 classes](https://lucasoshiro.github.io/posts-en/2024-03-24-openscad/),
  probably the first one on this subject in Portuguese;

- **Kotlin** (Competent): my main language when working at
  [Loggi](https://www.loggi.com/), where I was in the team responsible for the
  geocoding microservice;

- **Ruby** (Competent): language that I use for automating tasks when the
  limitations of Bash become a limitation. I described its adavantages for that
  purpose [in this blogpost](https://lucasoshiro.github.io/posts-en/2024-06-17-ruby-shellscript/),
  that was disseminated by the creator of the language;

- **Haskell** (Competent): my favorite language, even though I'm not a
  specialist in it. I only used it for side projects, such my 
  [own rewrite of Git](https://github.com/lucasoshiro/oshit);

- **Bash** (Competent)

- **C++** (Competent)

- **Lua** (Competent)

- **JavaScript** (Advanced beginner): a language that I know only learn the
  subset that I need for what I'm working on.

- **LISP family** (Advanced beginner): most used for my Emacs configuration in
  Elisp, even though I played with Hy and Scheme. I understand the idea of this
  familiy of languages and I have experience with functional programming, so
  I'll probably learn quickly another language of this family, such as Clojure
  or Common Lisp, if I need;

### Code management

- **Git** (Expert): Git is the tool that I most deeply understand. I contributed
  to its [source code](https://lucasoshiro.github.io/floss-en/2025-03-02-git/),
  wrote some blog posts about it, like 
  [this](https://lucasoshiro.github.io/posts-en/2023-02-13-git-debug/),
  [this](https://lucasoshiro.github.io/posts-en/2022-03-12-merge-submodule/) and
  [this](https://lucasoshiro.github.io/posts-en/2024-04-08-please_dont_squash/),
  translated to Portuguese the chapter about
  [its internals](https://lucasoshiro.github.io/floss-en/2021-09-18-pro_git/)
  from the official book and also rewrote a
  [subset of Git in Haskell](https://github.com/lucasoshiro/oshit) compatible
  with the official implementation;

- **GitHub actions** (Novice):

### Stacks

### Infrastructure

- **Linux** (Proficient): I'm a daily user of Linux since 2014;

- **Docker** (Proficient):

- **Kubernetes** (Novice):

- **AWS** (Novice):

### Frameworks

- **Django** (Competent): I worked with Django during my undergration and while
  I was working at [Loggi](https://www.loggi.com/). At Loggi, I wasn't in a team
  that was directly responsible of a Django-based application, however, given
  the horizontality of my team I needed to deal with Django-based apps from
  several other teams at that company;

- **Micronaut** (Competent):

- **ns-3** (Competent):

- **Löve2D** (Advanced beginner):

- **Rails** (Advanced beginner):

- **Native Android** (Advanced beginner):

- **React** (Novice): I only learned the basics of React.

### Data science and analisys

- **Pandas** (Proficient):

- **Jupyter** (Proficient):

- **SQL** (Competent):

- **TensorFlow** (Novice):

### Testing

- **JUnit**

- **PyTest**

- **Git test suite**

- **ns-3 test suite**


### General knowledge

- **Electronics** (Advanced beginner): I never oficially studied electronics,
  but I'm interested in this topic. I assembled
  [my own 3D printer](https://lucasoshiro.github.io/hardware-en/2020-06-14-3d_printer/)
  at home and sometimes I like to fix old equipments, even if I need to spend time
  learning more about this subject;

- **Functional programming** (Competent):

- **Language and automata theory** (Advanced beginner):

- **Algorithms** (Advanced beginner):

- **Category Theory** (Novice): this is a more abstract topic on Math, that I
  started to be interested after learning Haskell, which is a language based on
  its principles. Learning its basics allowed me to have a more abstract and
  higher-level perspective on programming;
  
- **Lambda calculus** (Novice): another abstract Math topic that I started to be
  interested after learning functional programming. I wrote a
  [quicksort using only lambda calculus](https://lucasoshiro.github.io/software-en/2020-06-06-lambdasort/).
